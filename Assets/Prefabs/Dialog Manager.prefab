  - 'I knew the answer, butterflies they taste with their feet They can also see
    in ultraviolet  last year I squashed 120.5 bugs In the name of science One barely
    got away I wonder what it feels like to be crushed for just being there '
  - "I can hear them joking I thought they were my friends I didn\u2019t choose to
    be like that Where am i?"
  - I can see the fingers All pointing at me My face my feet are all their problems
    I just want to belong
  - "If i avoid all conflict I\u2019ll need to play pretend Posing as someone else
    entirely Someone with a  beginning and an end "
  - "I know im different, just don\u2019t know why I can do better, or at least try

    if they cried

    loved exploring the world and how it works I loved knowing the answers I still
    do."
